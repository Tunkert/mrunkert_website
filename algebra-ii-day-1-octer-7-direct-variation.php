					<p>A direct variation is a proportional relationship in which two values have a direct relationship with one another. In other words, if one value increases the other value increases proportionally. An example of direct variation could be hours worked and paycheck amount for <i>hourly employees</i>. Another example might be the speed of a plane and how far you fly.</p>
					<p>To see direct variation in a mathematical setting let's look at some examples:</p>
					<section id="example-1">
						<h2>Example 1</h2>
						<p>Which of the following is an example of direct variation?</p>
						<ul>
							<li>ab = 5</li>
							<li>a = 5b</li>
							<li>a = <sup>5</sup>/<sub>b</sub></li>
							<li>ab = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub></li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Strategy and Solution</h3>
						<p>In this situation, b is an example of direct variation. A generic example of direct variation is <em>y = kx</em>. This is pretty much the same thing with a = y, b = x, and 5 = k. Also, <em>when b increases a increases, and vice-versa.</em></p>

					<section id="example-2">
						<h2>Example 2</h2>
						<p>Which of the following is an example of direct variation?</p>
						<ul>
							<li>y = 5x</li>
							<li>y = <sup>5</sup>/<sub>x</sub></li>
							<li>xy = 5</li>
							<li>x + y = 5</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Strategy and Solution</h3>
						<p>The solution to this problem is a. When x increases y increases. When y increases x must also increase.</p>

					<section id="example-3">
						<h2>Example 3</h2>
						<p>Which of the following is an example of direct variation?</p>
						<ul>
							<li><sup>p</sup>/<sub>r</sub> = 20</li>
							<li>pr = 20</li>
							<li>p = <sup>20</sup>/<sub>r</sub></li>
							<li>r = <sup>5</sup>/<sub>p</sub></li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Strategy and Solution</h3>
						<p>In this case a is the correct solution. If we multiply both sides by r we get p = 20r. As r increases p will increase and vice-versa.</p>

					<section id="example-4">
						<h2>Example 4</h2>
						<p>Which of the following is an example of direct variation?</p>
						<ul>
							<li>ab = 10</li>
							<li>b = <sup>10</sup>/<sub>a</sub></li>
							<li>a = <sup>10</sup>/<sub>b</sub></li>
							<li>a = 10b</li>
						</ul>
						<p>In this case d is our correct solution. As b increases a will increase and vice-versa.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="conclusion">
						<h2>Conclusion</h2>
						<p>Direct variation is a proportional relationship between two values. As one value increases the other value must increase. Likewise as one value decreases the other value decreases. This is the way of things ... with direct variation.</p>
