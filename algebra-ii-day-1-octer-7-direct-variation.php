			<p>A direct variation is a proportional relationship in which two values have a direct relationship with one another. In other words, if one value increases the other value increases proportionally. An example of direct variation could be hours worked and paycheck amount for <i>hourly employees</i>. Another example might be the speed of a plane and how far you fly.</p>
			<p>To see direct variation in a mathematical setting let's look at some examples:</p>
			<section id="example-1">
				<h2>Example 1</h2>
				<p>Which of the following is an example of direct variation:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>ab = 5</li>
					<li>a = 5b</li>
					<li>a = <sup>5</sup>/<sub>b</sub></li>
					<li>ab = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub></li>
				</ul>
