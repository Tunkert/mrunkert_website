                    <h1>The Quadrants of the Coordinate Plane</h1>
                    <p>There are four quadrants in the coordinate plane starting with the upper right hand corner of the graph. This is known as Quadrant I. We then cycle through the remaining three quadrants in a counter-clockwise position, LIKE A BOSS.</p>
                    <p>Quadrant II is the the upper left corner of the graph. The x-values are negative here and the y-values are positive still.</p>
                    <p>Cycling counter-clockwise to Quadrant III both the x and y-values are negative and cycling into the 4th Quadrant, which is the lower left hand corner yields positive x-values but negative y-values.</p>
                    <p>In the picture below you have points on each of the four quadrants - like a boss.</p>

                    <p>Let's practice plotting points and placing them on the coordinate plane.</p>

                        <h2>Example 1</h2>
                        <p>Plot the point (3, 4) and label the Quadrant it is in.</p>
                        <h3>Strategy and Solution</h3>
                        <p>We'll first start out by plotting the point. To do that we'll need to go three right and then four up. (Always do x first and then y). Since both x and y are positive and we're in the upper right hand corner of the graph we're in Quadrant I.</p>

                        <h3>Strategy and Solution</h3>
                        <p>We'll first move 1 to the left, since x is negative, then 2 up, since y is positive. We'll plot the point here. Since the x-value is negative and the y-value is positive we know that we're in Quadrant II:</p>

                        <h3>Strategy and Solution</h3>
                        <p>We'll first move left 2 units and then go down 2 units. Both the x and y-values are negative so we know that we're in Quadrant III. </p>

                        <p>Now you know how to plot points and the four Quadrants of the coordinate plane ... hopefully. I could have done this conclusion better ... LIKE A BOSS.</p>
