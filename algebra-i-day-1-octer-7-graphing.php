					<p>Being able to graph points on a coordinate plane is a necesary skill for high school math and beyond. In this lesson you'll learn exactly how to do that ... LIKE A BOSS. I can't help myself ...</p>				
					<p>Let's look at some examples.</p>
					<section id="example-1">
						<h2>Example 1 - Graphing on a Coordinate plane</h2>
						<p>Graph the point (2, 5) on the coordinate plane.</p>
						<h3>Strategy and Solution</h3>
						<p>To do this you'll need to first go right from the center. The center is called the <em>origin</em> on the coordinate plane and is located at the point (0, 0).</p>
						<p>From the origin go right 2 units. This will bring you to the point (2, 0). Remember x always comes first in the coordinate pair.</p>
						<p>From the point (2, 0) you'll need to go up 5 units. This will bring you to the point (2, 5), which is the point you wanted to plot. Point the plot here. Here is an image of the point (2, 5).</p>

						<h2>Example 2 - Graphing on a Coordinate Plane</h2>
						<p>Graph the point (-2, 3) on the coordinate plane. </p>
						<h3>Strategy and Solution</h3>
						<p>In this example since the x value is <i>negative</i> you'll want to move left two units from the origin.</p>
						<p>This will bring you to the point (-2, 0).</p>
						<p>You'll now need to go up 3 units. This will bring you to the point (-2, 3). Plot the point.</p>
