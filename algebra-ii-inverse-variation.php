                    <h1>Inverse Variation</h1>
                    <p>Inverse variation is a proportional relationship where one value increases as the other value decreases. A generic equation that represents inverse variation as y = <sup>k</sup>/<sub>x</sub>. </p>
                    <p>Let's look at some examples:</p>
                    <section id="example-1">
                        <h2>Example 1</h2>
                        <p>Which of the following represents inverse variation?</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="lower-alpha">a = 5b</li>
                            <li class="lower-alpha"><sup>a</sup>/<sub>b</sub> = 5</li>
                            <li class="lower-alpha"><sup>b</sup>/<sub>a</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub></li>
                            <li class="lower-alpha">a = <sup>5</sup>/<sub>b</sub></li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                        <p>In this case d is the correct solution as when b increases a will decrease.</p>
                        <p>A table will help us visualize this:</p>
                        <table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
                            <tr>
                                <th>a</th>
                                <th>b</th>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>5</td>
                                <td>1</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>2.5</td>
                                <td>2</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>1.67</td>
                                <td>3</td>
                            </tr>
                        </table>
                        <p>We can see from the table that as a halves (2.5), then is cut into thirds (1.67), b is doubled then tripled. Hence the inverse variation. LIKE A BOSS.</p>

                    <section id="example-2">
                        <h2>Example 2</h2>
                        <p>Which of the following represents inverse variation?</p>
                        <p>Note: k equals 3.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="lower-alpha">yx = k</li>
                            <li class="lower-alpha">y = kx</li>
                            <li class="lower-alpha"><sup>y</sup>/<sub>x</sub> = k</li>
                            <li class="lower-alpha">y = k + x</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Strategy and Solution</h3>
                        <p>In this case yx = k is a perfect example of direct variation. If we divide both sides by x, we get y = <sup>k</sup>/<sub>x</sub>, the generic version of direct variation I mentioned above.</p>
                        <p>In class, we'll make a table with the value of k also.</p>

                        <h2>Example 3</h2>
                        <p>Which of the following represents inverse variation?</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="lower-alpha">x - y = 2</li>
                            <li class="lower-alpha">x + y = 2</li>
                            <li class="lower-alpha">xy = 2</li>
                            <li class="lower-alpha">x = 2 - y</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                        <p>xy = 2 is our example of inverse variation here. Let's make a table to demonstrate.</p>
                        <table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
                            <tr>
                                <th>x</th>
                                <th>y</th>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>1</td>
                                <td>2</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>2</td>
                                <td>1</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>4</td>
                                <td>0.5</td>
                            </tr>
                        </table>
                        <p>We can see here that as x doubles, y halves. As x is quadrupled, y is a fourth of it's original value.</p>

                        <p>Which of the following represents inverse variation?</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="lower-alpha">p = 5r</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>In this case we can throw out answer d, that's just ridiculous. a is an example of direct variation, so it can't be inverse variation as is example b. Only c is an example of inverse variation. We'll make a table of this one in class ... LIKE A BOSS.</p>

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Remember that direct variation is a proportional relationship where as one value increases the other value increases proportionally. Inverse variation is where as one value increases the other value decreases proportionally. When in doubt make a table to figure which is which.</p>
